# AirBacgroundMusic
AirBackgroundMusic is an ADOBE AIR Native Extension (ANE) to set the current audio session for iOS Devices.
It works both for IOS and Android (doesnt do anything for Android devices tough).
By setting the right audio session, it stops the music currently played.


# Installation
The ANE is already compiled. You can find under the folder Binaries. 
If you want to recompile it, just run ant in the same directory, after changing the parameters (called properties) in build.xml.
